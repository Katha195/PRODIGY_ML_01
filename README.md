In this repository I have implemented a liner regression model to predict the price of houses based on their square footage and the number of bedrooms and bathrooms. A linear regression is an algorithm that provides a linear relationship between an independent variable and a dependent variable to predict the outcome of future events. It is a statistical method used in machine learning for predictive analysis.

Here the predictions is dependent on the area, locality, size of rooms and other factors depending on which someone will decide to buy a house. 

In this repository the dataset which has been used is taken from:
